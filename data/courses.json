    "description": "Note: This course is intended for absolute beginners to programming OR those who don't mind a slower pace to learning Java. If you're looking for a faster-paced course, this may not be for you (though you can play back at 2x speed & may still find great things to learn). Also, even for those who already know some basic Java, you could skip over the parts you already know and focus on those you may not, like Regex, Streams/Lambdas API, Optionals, Date/Time, SQL/Database/JDBC sections that even seasoned Java developers may not know as well as they should. Many of my sections on these APIs are as long or longer than MANY stand-alone courses dedicated to just one of these topics - for similar prices. Check out my preview videos from each of those sections to gauge how deep I go into each topic.",

    "description": "You will learn Modern C++, for one.  Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.  If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date. The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations. You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as your instructor Frank has.",
